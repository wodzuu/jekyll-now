My ideas for upcoming blog posts are following:
* Unity 3D: Creating colorful gradient-based fog
* Unity 3D: Level-of-detail with shadow casting geometry change
* Unity 3D: Creating vertex shader for grass weaving on the wind
* Unity 3D: Note on Unity batching mechanism and vertex shaders utilising object space coordinates
* Unity 3D: Creating vertex shader simulating tree shaking on the wind - with complex vertical and horizontal movement
